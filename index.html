            <p>Came for lunch with my sister. We loved our Thai-style mains which were amazing with lots of flavour, very impressive for a vegetarian restaurant.

                But the service was below average and the chips were too terrible to finish.
                
                When we arrived at 1.40, we had to wait 20 minutes while they got our table ready. OK, so we didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant was only half full. There was no reason to make us wait at all.
                
                We ordered the chips as a side dish and they looked delicious. But, when we tasted them, they were overcooked and swimming in oil so we left most of them. We expected a lot more for $10!</p>

                <p>Southerners have a lot of expressions to relay their dislike of the summer's heat. "Hotter'n blue blazes" and "hotter than the hinges on the gates of Hades" are two I always remember hearing in my childhood.</p>

        <p>First, make the black tahini. Toast the sesame seeds in a small pan over a gentle heat until you can smell the sesame aroma. Transfer to a mini processor and blitz. Pour in the oil gradually until a paste forms. Add the maple syrup and blitz again. Tip into a small bowl until ready to use.</p>
